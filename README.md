# BuddyUp
Project for MLH New Years New Hack Hackathon 2021.

## Inspiration 
We wanted to create something unique that matches the user to another person that is taking the same route. This could help you make a friend during the trip and it also could prevent danger.

## What it does
The user selects a route to travel and then the user gets matched with other people that will be using the same app and taking the same route.

## How we built it
Used Django and Flask for the backend

Django, HTML, CSS for the frontend

Google Maps for the map API

## Accomplishments we're proud of 
Able to create a working app within the time limit we were given.
